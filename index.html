		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<img src="images/profilepic.jpg">

		<p>My name is Kiran.  I am a graduate of Binghamton University with a bachelors degree in Biology.  While working on the sales side of both the Health Care, and Banking industry, I realized that I was working in a capacity that I had no passion about.  This realization has led me to begin coding in my free time.  Shortly after messing around with basic code, I decided that this was something I could do as a career that would FULFILL ME.  I decided that the best way to push for that passion was to leave my job and attend a coding bootcamp in order to completely immerse myself in the art of web development.  Here is some of my first work- I hope you enjoy it!</p>
